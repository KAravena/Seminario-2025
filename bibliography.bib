Disparities rooted in SES have become more pronounced as social inequities have increased, and parental expectations for academic success have risen. This study aims to elucidate the intricate dynamics that affect student academic success. This study examines the critical role of family SES in contributing to student academic performance and identifies key factors that shape this relationship based on existing literature and research data. The study examines the direct impact of SES on academic performance and the mediating effect of parental educational contributions, demonstrating how parental participation might alleviate the challenges encountered by kids from lower SES families. To address this issue, the government and community can intervene to a certain extent. For educators and legislators to create successful interventions that assist underprivileged kids and advance educational equity, they must have a thorough understanding of these variables.}}

Global test score data is used to estimate learning losses by modeling the effect of school closures on achievement by predicting the deviation of the most recent results from a linear trend using data from all rounds of PISA. Mathematics scores declined an average of 14 percent of a standard deviation, roughly equal to seven months of learning. Losses are greater for students in schools that faced relatively longer closures, for boys, immigrants, and disadvantaged students. Educational losses may translate into significant national income losses over time.}}

Se crearon modelos de análisis multinivel (5 para Matemáticas y 5 para Lectura). Como resultados, se destaca la incidencia de la repitencia y de la posición del estudiante en el Indicador Socioeconómico y de Capital Cultural (ISECC). La discusión considera la complejidad del proceso enseñanza-aprendizaje debido a la diversidad de condiciones socioculturales de los estudiantes, experiencia educativa e individualidad, a pesar de existir referentes colectivos para categorizar a los estudiantes en grupos únicos. Como principales conclusiones se observa la incidencia del ISECC en ambas áreas evaluadas. Se propone para futuras investigaciones indagar el efecto de las variables segmentando poblaciones, según dimensiones de ISECC, otros referentes estratégicos u otras variables de incidencia dentro del aula.}}

A systematic approach to review the published and available documents in online databases. The researcher reaches the point of saturation by browsing 68 published documents. These documents have been selected using the inclusion criteria on gender differentials in academic performance in higher education. The study findings outline that biological differences are less likely to affect the performance of female and male students rather than shaped by cultural differences. Females’ deprivation of education was due to the traditional and cultural practices in male hegemonic society. The study concludes that the difference in educational performance among female and male students in higher education is not linked with biological characteristics. It has roots in the difference of psycho-social, socio-economic, and cultural factors of socialization among female and male students.}}
